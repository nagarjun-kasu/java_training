/*
Interface:
Interface is same as class. It contains both abstract and non-abstract methods (default methods, static methods, private method)
If a class implements an interface, it must provide implementation for all abstract methods.

Interface is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.
All the methods in an interface are public and abstract.
All variables declared in an interface are public static final (constant)
It is not possible to create object for interface, but we can hold the object in interface reference.
It is not possible to declare the constructor inside the interface.
A class can implement multiple interfaces.
An interface can extend multiple interfaces.
