TypeCasting: Converting one data type into another data type.

1. Widening or implicit type casting:
The process of converting lower data type into higher data type is called widening type casting.

byte --> short --> int --> long --> float --> double

		 char --> int --> long --> float --> double


2. Narrowing or explicit type casting:
The process of converting higher data type into lower data type is called narrowing type casting.

double --> float --> long --> int --> char --> short --> byte



byte < short < int < long < float < double
 	   char
